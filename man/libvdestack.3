namespace as a user library

.PP
\f[CB]void vde_default_stack(struct vdestack *\f[R]\f[I]stack\f[R]\f[CB]);\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Libvdestack implements the idea of Internet of Threads through network
namespaces.
By libvdestack a program can use one (or even several) private
networking protocol stack(s), thus a program can be assigned its own IP
address(es), routing etc.
.TP
\f[CB]vde_addstack\f[R]
create a private network namespace: \f[I]vdenet\f[R] is the URL\-like
specification of a vde network as described in :\f[CB]vde_plug\f[R](1).
\f[I]ifname\f[R] is the name of the interface in the network namespace.
When \f[I]ifname\f[R] is NULL, the default interface :name is vde0.
.TP
\f[CB]vde_delstack\f[R]
destroy a vdestack when it is no longer needed.
.TP
\f[CB]vde_stackcmd\f[R]
run a command or a comma separated sequence of commands in the private
network namespace.
The purpose of
this function is to configure the networking parameters and options
(e.g.\ IP address, routing).
For security reasons,
commands must be specified using full pathnames.
Do not use this function to start long lasting or non terminating
programs,
the caller waits for the termination of the command sequence.
.TP
\f[CB]vde_msocket\f[R]
it has the same semantics of \f[CB]socket\f[R](2) except that the socket
is defined in the scope of the network namespace
whose descriptor is the first argument.
The remaining arguments are those defined in socket(2).
.TP
\f[CB]vde_default_stack\f[R]
define the default stack: any successive socket(2) call will use the
stack passed as parameter to
vde_default_stack.
Use NULL to undefine the default stack.
.SH RETURN VALUE
\f[CB]vde_addstack\f[R] returns a struct vdestack pointer which is used
as a descriptor and thus passed as an argument to the other functions of
this library.
NULL is returned in case of error.
.PP
\f[CB]vde_stackcmd\f[R] returns the exit status of the command.
If the stackcmd argument is a comma separated sequence of commands, the
execution terminates upon the first command whose exit status is not
zero, and the exit status of that command is returned.
Therefore when vde_stackcmd returns zero the entire sequence was
successfully executed.
.PP
On success, \f[CB]vde_msocket\f[R] returns a valid file descriptor.
\-1 is returned elseways and errno is set appropriately as described in
socket(2).
.SH NOTES
Libvdestack fails if user namespaces have not been configured in the
running kernel and enabled for users.
In Debian the sysctl knob \f[CB]kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone\f[R]
must be set to 1.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following excerpt of C code shows the use of libvdestack:
.IP
.EX
\&...
int fd;
int exit_status;
struct vdestack *stack = vde_addstack(\[dq]vde://\[dq], NULL);
if (stack == NULL)
    ... error management
exit_status = vde_stackcmd(stack,
          \[dq]/bin/ip link set vde0 up;\[dq]
          \[dq]/bin/ip addr add 10.0.0.1/24 dev vde0;\[dq]
          \[dq]/bin/ip route add default via 10.0.0.254\[dq]);
if (exit_status != 0)
   ... error management
fd = vde_msocket(stack, AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
   ... fd can be used in any context in which a file descriptor returned by socket(2) can.
e.g. bind, accept, connect, read/write, send/recv ...
vde_delstack(stack);
